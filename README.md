Classify cancer tumors into Malignant or Benign based on the training data (used to train a deep learning model).

Designed a deep learning model using Tensorflow and Python to classify cancer tumors into Malignant or Benign based on the training data (used to train a deep learning model). This project can help doctors to classify patients based on the severity in the form of various test results attributes. This type of projects can help mankind by saving lives.
